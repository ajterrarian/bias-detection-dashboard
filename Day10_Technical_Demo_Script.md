## Phase 2: Mathematical Framework Deep Dive

### Step 2.1: Bias Metrics Explanation (2 minutes)
**Action:** Navigate to Mathematical tab, show bias gradient visualization

**Script:**
*"Our mathematical approach goes beyond simple accuracy comparisons. We implement four core bias metrics:*

*1. **Statistical Parity** - measures outcome rate differences between groups*
*2. **Equalized Odds** - ensures equal true/false positive rates*  
*3. **Accuracy Disparity** - quantifies performance gaps*
*4. **Information-Theoretic Bias** - uses mutual information between demographics and outcomes*

*This 3D visualization shows bias gradients across demographic manifolds - the arrows indicate the direction of increasing bias, and the color intensity represents bias magnitude."*

**Mathematical Concepts to Explain:**
- Differential geometry approach to bias quantification
- Information theory applications in fairness
- Gradient-based bias detection
- Manifold analysis of demographic spaces

### Step 2.2: Information Theory Visualization (1.5 minutes)

**Script:**
*"This heatmap displays mutual information between demographic attributes and model outcomes. Darker regions indicate higher correlation - suggesting potential bias.*

*The mathematical foundation uses entropy and KL divergence:*
- *Mutual Information: I(D;Y) = Σ P(d,y) log[P(d,y)/(P(d)P(y))]*
- *This quantifies how much knowing demographics tells us about outcomes*

*Values close to zero indicate fairness, while higher values suggest bias."*

### Step 2.3: Optimization Theory Application (1 minute)
**Action:** Display Pareto frontier plot

**Script:**
*"This Pareto frontier shows the fundamental trade-off between accuracy and fairness. Each point represents an optimal balance - you can't improve one without sacrificing the other.*

**Script:**
*"Results are streaming in real-time. Notice how the bias metrics update dynamically:*

- *Statistical Parity: 0.156 - indicating 15.6% difference in outcome rates*
- *Accuracy Disparity: 0.089 - showing 8.9% performance gap*
- *All results include 95% confidence intervals for statistical rigor*

*The system automatically flags significant bias (p < 0.001) and provides actionable insights."*

### Step 3.3: Interactive Visualization Updates (1.5 minutes)
**Action:** Demonstrate real-time chart updates

**Script:**
*"Watch how visualizations update automatically as new data arrives. The ROC curves show performance differences across demographic groups - Group A clearly outperforms Group D.*

*These aren't static charts - they're interactive. You can zoom, pan, and hover for detailed information."*

## Phase 4: Bias Mitigation Demonstration

### Step 4.1: Mitigation Algorithm Selection (1 minute)
**Action:** Navigate to bias mitigation interface

**Script:**
*"Once bias is detected, our system offers multiple mitigation strategies:*

1. *Threshold Optimization - adjusts decision boundaries*
2. *Lagrange Multiplier Fairness - constrained optimization*
3. *Calibration Adjustment - probability recalibration*
4. *Feature Transformation - demographic-aware preprocessing*

*Let's apply threshold optimization to our biased dataset."*

### Step 4.2: Before/After Comparison (2 minutes)
**Action:** Run bias mitigation and show results

**Script:**
*"The mitigation algorithm is processing... and here are the results:*

- *Original bias: 0.156*
- *Mitigated bias: 0.089*  
- *43% improvement in fairness*

*Notice how the visualization updates to show the improved bias landscape. The system maintains statistical rigor - all improvements are statistically significant."*
