## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set up API credentials:
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_aws_access_key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_aws_secret_key"
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/service-account-key.json"
```

## Usage

### FastAPI Backend Server
Start the FastAPI server:
```bash
python Day7_FastAPI_Backend.py
```

This starts the backend server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` with:
- Comprehensive REST API endpoints for bias analysis
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Interactive API documentation at `/docs`
- Export capabilities (PDF, CSV, LaTeX, PNG)
- Performance optimization and caching

### React Dashboard
Start the React dashboard (requires Node.js):
```bash
cd dashboard
npm install  # First time only
npm start
```

The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and automatically connects to the Python backend.

### Complete Analysis Pipeline
Run the complete analysis pipeline:
```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
1. Test API connections
2. Load sample diverse face dataset
3. Process images through facial recognition APIs
4. Calculate bias metrics using statistical analysis
5. Generate interactive visualizations

## Output

The tool generates several HTML visualizations in the `output/` directory:
- `accuracy_heatmap.html` - Heat map of accuracy across demographic groups
- `bias_disparity_chart.html` - Comprehensive bias metrics dashboard
- `demographic_comparison.html` - Side-by-side service comparisons
- `comprehensive_dashboard.html` - Complete analysis dashboard

## Bias Metrics Implemented

### Statistical Measures
- **Accuracy Disparity**: Range and variance of accuracy across groups
- **Statistical Parity**: Difference in positive prediction rates
- **Equalized Odds**: True/false positive rate differences
- **Demographic Parity**: Equal treatment across groups

### Mathematical Framework
- **Differential Geometry**: Bias gradient calculations using surface interpolation
- **Individual Fairness**: Similarity-based outcome consistency
- **Pairwise Disparities**: All group-to-group comparisons
