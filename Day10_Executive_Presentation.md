### Slide 5: Mathematical Methodology - Bias Metrics

**Core Bias Formulations:**

**Statistical Parity:**
$$\text{SP} = \max_{i,j} |P(Y=1|G=G_i) - P(Y=1|G=G_j)|$$

**Equalized Odds:**
$$\text{EO} = \max_{i,j,t} |P(\hat{Y}=1|T=t,G=G_i) - P(\hat{Y}=1|T=t,G=G_j)|$$

**Information-Theoretic Bias:**
$$I(D;Y) = \sum_{d,y} P(d,y) \log \frac{P(d,y)}{P(d)P(y)}$$

**Differential Geometry Approach:**
$$\nabla B(d) = \left(\frac{\partial B}{\partial d_1}, \frac{\partial B}{\partial d_2}, \ldots, \frac{\partial B}{\partial d_n}\right)$$
